# JupyterLab and OpenAI Setup Script

This script automates the setup of JupyterLab and OpenAI on macOS using Homebrew and Python virtual environments.

## Prerequisites

- macOS operating system
- Internet connection

## What the Script Does

1. Checks for and installs Homebrew if not present
2. Updates Homebrew
3. Installs Python3 if not already installed
4. Creates a virtual environment for JupyterLab and OpenAI
5. Installs JupyterLab, ipykernel, and OpenAI package in the virtual environment
6. Adds the virtual environment as a kernel in JupyterLab
7. Creates a basic OpenAI configuration file

## Usage

1. Save the script with a `.sh` extension (e.g., `setup_jupyterlab_openai.sh`)
2. Make the script executable:
3. chmod +x setup_jupyterlab_openai.sh
Copy3. Run the script:
./setup_jupyterlab_openai.sh
Copy
## Post-Installation Steps

1. Update the `openai_config.py` file with your actual OpenAI API key
2. Launch JupyterLab by running:
jupyter-lab
Copy
## Notes

- The script creates a virtual environment named `jupyterlab-env` in the current directory
- The OpenAI configuration file is created as `openai_config.py` in the current directory
- Ensure you have sufficient permissions to install software on your system

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation, check the following:

- Ensure you have an active internet connection
- Verify that you have the necessary permissions to install software
- Check for any error messages in the script output

For further assistance, consult the documentation for Homebrew, Python, JupyterLab, or OpenAI as needed.
